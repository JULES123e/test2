    <h2>Oil Awash In Mixed signals</h2>
        
            <div class="blank-space"></div>
   
    <p>• Strong crude pricing not matched by recent inventory
    changes</br>
    • Localised crude balances and more bullish consensus on still
    large uncertainties driving pricing</br>
    • Incoming product demand data already suggest a softening
    in implied crude needs even this summer, let alone next year</p></br>
    Physical crude and futures pricing is rapidly approaching the strength observed immediately
    after the outbreak of conflict in Ukraine. This is somewhat at odds with the global crude
    balance, which is still trending above seasonal averages, builds in commercial crude inventory
    since January, and reduced uncertainties regarding Russian oil exports for the short term.</br>
    Brent futures have been sustaining extreme backwardation once again, while cash/futures
    spreads and diffs in West Africa and the Med have been on a tear. M6 Brent remains at some
    $110. Net length in Brent has risen considerably over the last few weeks. All this, while
    Russian crude exports are trending at some of the highest levels seen in more than two years
    and significantly stronger than pre-conflict. Russian product exports are also relatively stable,
    while refinery intake and crude production gained significantly over H1 June.</br>
    It is reasonable to say that in this extremely difficult market, fair value for timespreads,
    relative prices, and margins remains extremely difficult to assess. Reading too much into
    large moves currently is somewhat futile. However, we think some price signals and their
    notional market messages do not quite match up with the current physical and marginal indications about the future. (Let us for the moment ignore significant tail-end risks, such as
    the unilateral and pre-emptive reduction in oil and gas to Europe from the Russian side. A
    quick look at European natgas these last few days is a reminder of such risks).

<h2>West Of Suez Perfect Storm</h2>
<div class="blank-space"></div>
    In the crude market, particularly West of Suez (WoS), an extreme price setup is being
    impacted by extra-ordinary as well as one-off factors. These include:
<div class="very-small-blank-space"></div>
    <p>• Significant outages and maintenance, including maintenance in Norway and
    Kazakhstan, and outages in Libya</br>
    • The ongoing redirection of global crude flows - Europe is pulling in significantly more
    barrels from the Atlantic Basin (ex-Russia) than pre-conflict, alongside extra Middle
    Eastern barrels. Preference for light sweets has been high up to this point</br>
    • At the same time Europe had a very strong overall month of imports in May, which  
    serviced higher runs but also built stocks</br>
    • Gasoline’s meteoric rise since April and massive residue sulphur spreads have also
    boosted light-sweet crude GPWs</br>
    • Brent futures/spreads are more prone to geopolitical and speculative influences than
    other benchmarks (more on this below)</p>

    <h2>Forward Expectations Turned More Bullish </br>While Macro Darkens</h2>
    <div class="blank-space"></div>
We are not heedless of the fact that forward expectations are also driving prices. The
consensus appears to be trending if anything more bullish. We think this moves against the
marginal indications of what balances will look like even for the next weeks, let alone the
rest of the year and into 2023.</br><div class="very-small-blank-space"></div>
<span> EU phase out</span> was a key moment of the last few weeks, but widely anticipated in its
eventual form. The phase out of non-exempted Russian oil should, however, take place
relatively slowly. Our June nowcast for Russian flows to OECD Europe is actually higher m/m.
A slow phase-out gives Russia ample time to explore the various options to keep its oil on
the market.</br><div class="very-small-blank-space"></div>
<span>The insurance ban</span> included in the sixth round of sanctions may not ultimately prove a
great hinderance to Russian liftings, even if the UK enacts its own version and assuming the
US administration does not work to soften the measures. State-backed and off-circuit
insurers, the utilisation of state-owned and a variety of smaller tanker players, the use of
STS, and other regulatory loopholes all provide outlets. It may be more likely that freight
markets simply increasingly bifurcate (with strong implications for rates in the main freight
tier).</br><div class="very-small-blank-space"></div>
<span>OPEC production</span> rightfully remains a key source of speculation and invariably a bullish one
particularly when viewed through the by now rather defunct lens of missed OPEC+ targets.
We think Saudi, Kuwait, UAE, and Iraq still have at least some upside through to September.
Beyond that, things get difficult - political pressure may see some of them break through
capacity barriers by drawing stocks for some weeks, but obviously this is not a medium-term
solution.</br><div class="very-small-blank-space"></div>
Talk of flatlining crude exports also often does not account for rising crude runs – June
throughput in these four countries is running a good 700 KBD higher y/y, and with further
upside ahead given the start-up of Al Zour (Jazan also has the potential to run higher). That
reduces crude exports but also increases much-needed product exports.</br><div class="very-small-blank-space"></div>
<span>China</span> has recently also invariably been painted in a bullish light for the rest of the year,
despite the doubling down of authorities on ‘Zero Covid’ and renewed outbreaks of an
extremely transmissible virus. What is more, China is already importing crude at levels higher
than last year – so in order to view China as a bullish element in the coming quarters (i.e.
even higher imports), one needs to predict no further lockdowns, a return to normal crude
runs, and a continuation of strong stock builds as well (<span>Apr-May builds ran at +850 KBD</span>
– we presume this won’t be sustained in any event). 
    <div class="blank-space"></div>
    <div class="very-small-blank-space"></div>
    <div class="thumbnail-image">
        <img src="https://github.com/JULES123e/Oilx-help/blob/16d334795f7a68e82844760fcfa2342d7428e0d6/figure3.png" height="500" width="920" >

    <div class="blank-space"></div>
    <div class="very-small-blank-space"></div>

<span>Refinery runs</span> (ex-China) continue to struggle higher. OECD runs could still have significant
upside in our view but may struggle to maintain much higher levels than now for several
months at a time. That means our already manageable summer crude balances get softer
but it also paves the way for further volatility in margins and cracks. The US is also
approaching Hurricane Season. As such and with little progress having been made on
rebuilding product stocks in recent weeks, Q3 or Q4 margins remain potential targets to be
dragged up by prompt disruptions.</br><div class="very-small-blank-space"></div>
<span>Product demand</span> is not liable to shift that much from consensus in the short term, though
there is an argument that the most difficult areas to monitor demand are also the most likely
to witness stronger demand destruction (the Non-OECD, where economic/social crises
continue to spring up). Even in the US, weekly gasoline and diesel numbers are combined
painting a picture that is difficult to ignore and very soft relative to expectations and
seasonality.</br><div class="very-small-blank-space"></div>
What about the golden child of demand this year – jet? NWE jet is soaring for now, but
outside of this region, dare we say it that demand (ex-Russia and China) is actually
disappointing? It is early days yet, but our June nowcasts are not yet showing the type of
seasonal uptick that might be expected or was seen even last year. Progress is slow in many
formerly important jet demand nations particularly East of Suez, such as Thailand and Hong
Kong. Overall, progress against pre-Covid levels also appears to have stalled.

        <img src="https://github.com/JULES123e/Oilx-help/blob/16d334795f7a68e82844760fcfa2342d7428e0d6/figure4.png" height="500" width="920" >
    </div>
    <div class="blank-space"></div>
    <span> demand is coming into the spotlight</span> and is still viewed with a lot of upside, driven
structurally by post-Covid recoveries. There are growing signals that even if demand this
summer to a great extent meets expectations, even rich nations are already running on fumes
in terms of their ability to manage these high prices and the rest of their cost-of-living issues
(including strongly rising mortgage repayments etc.). Spiking consumer credit data reflects
this notion. That could imply a post-summer slump.</br><div class="very-small-blank-space"></div>
The IEA has now had its first crack at 2023 demand growth, forecasting a huge 2.2 MBD y/y
on top of 1.8 MBD in 2022. Have prolonged high prices, a widespread cost-of-living crisis,
likely recession, spreading social and economic disruption, and structural behavioural
changes been addressed in full yet? Big growth numbers are also dependent on China
emerging from this and from covid unscathed, and therefore rapidly accelerating its oil
demand numbers next year. Meanwhile, the EIA has lowered its outright 2023 oil demand
levels by about 1 million b/d since January, with both 2022 and 2023 growth revised
incrementally lower. The similarities to forecasting efforts between 2007 and 2009 are
already there, but the current bull cycle thesis is built upon an increasingly rosy end-user
demand basis. The way things are headed, there is an argument to be made that demand
growth next year can, at best, be limited to as much supply growth can be put together.
